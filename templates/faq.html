				<h3 class="faq">What is MUPy?</h3>
				<p>MUPy is geared to be an unconventional conference where the talks are about interesting projects instead of research papers. Following the much revered and successful style of PyCon, the speakers hail from various ends of the industry to introduce the audience to the versatility, ease of use and power of Python, as they talk about their projects and experience with the language.</p>

				<p>Here is the ELI5 version. You come, sit, listen to grown-ups talk (patronizing? You’re five, you don’t even know what that means) about how they used a particular programming language to make their everyday lives so much more easier. You still have the chance to ask them about it and get to learn more.</p>

				<p>Python stopped being just for the Gates a long time ago, its for the Wozniaks as well. A lot of what can be done through MATLAB or LabVIEW can be done on Python or softwares made using Python for <a href="https://az616578.vo.msecnd.net/files/2015/05/14/635672207217133457-1762359024_itsfofreegif.gif">freeee</a>!</p>

				<p>To introduce Manipal to Python & its related frameworks.</p>
				<p>Python is like the young (but experienced), talks less (lesser lines of code) and works more type of person of the opposite sex (we are big on gender equality). It’s only a matter of time before you decide to leave your spouse (C, C++, Java) and have a little fun with Python.</p>
