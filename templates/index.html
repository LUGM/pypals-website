PyPals is inviting speakers from across the country to give talks at MUPy. We are also inviting alumni of our college to inspire current undergrads. We plan to have workshops to introduce first and second year students to Python. The motivation behind starting MUPy is to emulate the success of PyCon India.

				<p class="body">
					Walk-in to any of the talks between the scheduled times. It won't be a workshop. Come with an open mind and listen-in on the people from the industry sharing their experiences with Python. For those who respond to their peers, check out student developers talking about their experience with the language and related frameworks. If you wish to deliver a talk, please send a formal proposal to the <a href="mailto:contact@pypals.org">PyPals team</a>. Interested in collaborating on an idea? Come pitch it to the masses in one of the flash talks and you could find people to code away together.
