It allows individuals to transfer money to each other without having an intermediary source snooping in on their private transaction. \n\nBitcoin's rebellious notions put aside the real ground breaking tech that has emerged from it is the blockchain. The blockchain is central to the concept of Bitcoin as all transactions that occur over the Bitcoin network are post validation stored in the blockchain. \n\nThe height and longevity of the blockchain for any currency is a testament to the legitimacy of initial transactions.

    "description": "\nFrom constant monitoring of data using Excel and analyzing countless graphs to developing statistical models to automate the whole procedure, we’ve come a long way in our approach to detect anomalies in processes.\n\nEver wondered why a cardiologist spends hours looking a patient’s medical history? Or why banks keep an extremely detailed track of their users’ transactions? Time series data provides an answer to how your regular processes should behave and why in some bizarre cases they do not.\n\nThis talk will be about how machine learning models are now being used to predict when the next anomaly will occur and whether the current data seems to suggest an anomaly that we’ve encountered before, with a special focus on supervised learning.\n\nI will give examples of how this is taken up by various industry sectors and explain how the same algorithms can be applied to sophisticated applications like handwriting and speech recognition. In specific, I will explain how the manufacturing sector uses data science techniques in order to give their processes and products an edge over the others.\n\nThis talk will also explore basic visualization and preliminary data analysis techniques, specific to this context, and you may see some bouts of extreme devotion towards Pandas because well, let’s admit it, that library is GOD.\n\nThe structure of the talk will be as follows:\n\n- Intro to Anomaly Detection + Applications\n- Time series analysis\n- Algorithms currently in use\n- Python libraries used\n- Code demo a. EDA: Basic techniques b. Fault detection\n- Pre-requisites\n\nBasic stats, ML and Python knowledge\nLove for Pandas (the library)",

    "description": "\nThe project involved developing an interactive Heads up Display (HUD) on the OCULUS RIFT for the V-ERAS Simulation (VR simulation of the Eras Mars Station). Once the interactive semi-transparent interface is implemented on the existing V-ERAS simulation environment it should display data from the Habitat Monitoring Client. The Habitat Monitoring Client GUI is already in place. The GUI needed to be integrated with the blender game engine which runs the simulation through blender python API. The Habitat Monitoring Client can interface with any general Tango Device Server. This Device Server could be any Sensor placed on the Mars environment. The HMC could get a request from the user to poll a specific server and get the average, minimum or maximum of the values. A portion of the project was aimed at making the HUD highly interactive and recognize touchless hand and body gestures through Leap Motion Controller. The Leap Motion Controller is able to detect Hand gestures. The Leap motion controller (LMC) will be integrated with Blender through the Leap Motion API for Python which will result in controlling simulation in Blender Game Engine (BGE) using hand movement gestures. There are four standard gestures recognized by the Leap Motion software through the Gesture Class in its Python API. The Leap API for Python will communicate with the Blender API for Python (bpy) to feed the data from the LMC server into the BGE so that the simulation of V-ERAS can be controlled through the Leap Motion Controller using gestures.",
