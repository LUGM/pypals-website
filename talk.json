    "description": "This talk will briefly introduce word embeddings that have become a standard representation in natural language processing. We will discuss the shortcomings of universal embeddings like word2vec and Glove and what new directions are being explored to overcome their disadvantages. The talk will give details about the new ELMo embedding model and give a general overview of how, when, and where should they be used in your NLP projects. Finally the talk will give a sneak peek into the work happening at UMass Amherst to overcome some of the problems encountered in the field.",
